# Steam Microtransaction API

An intermediate api to handle steam microtransactions using steam web services.

You can use and consume this API with Unity, Unreal, Godot or any engine you want to develop a steam game.

## What is this?

Based on the Steamworks documentation, to implement microtransactions in your game you need to create a webservice to handle and request the Steam web API.

To save time and money, I decided to create one unique code to help game developers to implement microtransactions quickly.

## How can I use?

This API is typescript (Nodejs v12+) based api and you can use services like heroku, digital ocean to implement this API in 2 ou 3 steps.
